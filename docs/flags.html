    <div class="about">
        <p>
            The Dragonrealms MUD has a number of server-side settings which are specifically created for the official
            game clients. As the Frostbite frontend is based on Stormfront network protocol, it accomodates the
            same shared server-side settings as the Stormfront client and any changes in those settings will be reflected
            in both game clients.
        </p><p>
            The crossed out settings will not have any effect in the Frostbite frontend and it is important to note
            that some of the settings might not affect the GUI but they could still be used by the scripting engine.
            For example the inventory list which cannot be seen in the GUI but it can still be accessed from the scripts
            created for the Frostbite frontend.
