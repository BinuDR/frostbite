    <div class="about">
        <p>
            The Frostbite project was first started in the beginning of 2012 with a purpose to reestablish the gaming experience that
            has been brought to many adventurers of Dragonrealms by the game applications which are now struggling to keep up
            with the changing world of computers. The Frostbite frontend is largely inspired by the legendary Wizard which
            goes back decades since it was first released but is still going strong. However it feels like some improvements
            are in order. Therefore the Frostbite frontend attempts to capture the look and feel of the Wizard while still
            utilizing some of the more advanced features of the Stormfront and yet adds a few new approaches on its own.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The project is based on open source practices and the credits for making the client go to all of
            the parties that have provided the means to make everything possible.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt framework</a> - the core framework for building the client software;</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> - providing the scripting support for the frontend;</li>
            <li><a href="http://opengameart.org">OpenGameArt.org</a> - bringing the design elements for the user interface,
                provided by many artists for which special thanks go out to Ravenmore and Dakal for their generous
                contribution to the entire open game development community;
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a> - text editor packaged into the Frostbite
                installation.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The client is still a work in progress and does not provide a full support for all the functions in
            the game -- it has to be used with caution accordingly.
