<style id=""/><preset id='roomDesc'>The two-story dwellings on the north side of the street are sequestered by high town walls.  Shade trees from the inner yards of the houses hang over into the street.  Surrounding one well-kept gate, a colorful wall mural relieves the dun-colored monotony of the protective ramparts.
