    <div class="about">
        <p>
            The Frostbite project was first started in the beginning of 2012. The main goal was to make automatic tasks
            more flexible while still maintaining the same level of gaming experience that has been brought to the adventurers
            by many of the popular frontends like Wizard and Stormfront. The main focus was to bring back some of the functions that
            were lost with Stormfront but were still proven to be useful and in addition improve on some new functions of
            it's own. The Frostbite has been primarily inspired by the Wizard however it is based on Stormfront
            down to it's very core.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The Frostbite project is based on open source technologies and the credits for making everything possible go
            to all the parties that have provided the means for it.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt framework</a> - the core framework for building the client software;</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> - providing the scripting support for the frontend;</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> - hosting all the project related files and source code;</li>
            <li><a href="http://opengameart.org">OpenGameArt.org</a> - bringing the design elements for the user interface,
                provided by many artists of which special thanks go out to Ravenmore and Dakal for their generous
                contribution to the entire open game development community;
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a> - text editor packaged into the Frostbite
                installation.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p class="alert-box">
            The client is still a work in progress and does not provide a full support for all the functions in
            the game -- it has to be used with caution accordingly.
